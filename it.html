      <!-- WHAT IS IT OPS -->
      <h2>What is IT operations for a company?</h2>
      <p>
        IT operations is how a business manages the tools employees need to work —
        laptops, accounts, permissions, security, and the process of giving and removing access.
        For most companies, the biggest pain is not “technology” — it’s the workflow and control.
      </p>

      <!-- CORE PARTS -->
      <h2>Core parts of IT for teams</h2>
      <div class="grid">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Device management</h3>
          <p>
            Track laptops, phones, and equipment: who has what, when it was issued, and when it’s returned.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Account provisioning</h3>
          <p>
            Create access for tools like email, Slack, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and internal systems —
            with approvals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Permissions & access control</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure employees only have the access they need — reducing risk and keeping control as the team grows.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Onboarding workflows</h3>
          <p>
            New joiner steps: request device, set up accounts, confirm access, and record completion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Offboarding workflows</h3>
          <p>
            Remove access on time, recover devices, and document completion — critical for security and compliance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Security & audit trail</h3>
          <p>
            Record who approved access, when accounts were created or removed, and what devices were issued.
          </p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
      <h2>Why IT is important (especially in the UK)</h2>
      <p>
        Poor IT processes create security risks and business disruption. In the UK, data handling and access control
        also matter for compliance and customer trust — especially when staff change frequently.
      </p>

      <!-- WHAT GOES WRONG -->
      <h2>What happens when IT is not managed properly?</h2>
      <div class="grid">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Security risk</h3>
          <p>
            Former employees keep access to email or systems, leading to data leakage and serious reputational damage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Slow onboarding</h3>
          <p>
            New hires waste days without a laptop or accounts, reducing productivity and creating a bad first impression.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Lost devices & costs</h3>
          <p>
            Without tracking, equipment goes missing and replacement costs rise quickly as the team grows.
          </p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <!-- ORDIN POSITIONING -->
